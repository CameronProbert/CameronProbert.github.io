    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <p>
      After reading about time management as part of EDA Phase 0, I
      have decided I will try the Pomodoro Technique. I notice that
      Toggl has this functionality built in.
      <br>
      I find it interesting that many guides that talk about time
      management almost focus more on break times than productive
      times. I guess that if you work solidly for a long period of
      time then you burn out, and you can't really call that 'time
      management'.
      what worked for you?
      which will you experiment further with?
