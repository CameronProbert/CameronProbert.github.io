          After reading about time management as part of EDA Phase 0, I
          have decided I will try the Pomodoro Technique. I notice that
          Toggl has this functionality built in.
          <br>
          <br>
          I find it interesting that many guides that talk about time
          management almost focus more on break times than productive
          times. I guess that if you work solidly for a long period of
          time then you burn out, and you can't really call that 'time
          management'.
          <br><br>
          Update: I have been trying to use the Pomodoro Technique and
          have been enjoying it so far. I have found that I can work on
          a problem without interruption or distraction for 25 minutes
          and the break time lets me do things that I have been thinking
          about while working and get them out of my system.
          <br><br>
          I'm going to keep using the Pomodoro technique for the foreseeable
          future. I am sure I will only get better at it as I continue
          using it.
