          <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>
            I focused much more on following the guidelines and really utilising the skeleton library, rather than trying to add every feature I could think of as I have done in the past. This really simplified the process of rebuilding the site. I managed to rebuild
            the site to look much the same as before but in much less time and with much less code.

          <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
          <p>
            I have always enjoyed meditating. Reading about the benefits of meditation only makes me want to practise more!

          <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
          <p>
            I didn't realise that medititation can help with concentration so much. It apparently also has many mental and physiological benefits.

          <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
          <p>
            I liked the idea of sitting as if you were a mountain. I think it is easier to put yourself in a position where you feel strong and majestic rather than try to follow specific sitting instructions.

          <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          <p>
            After reading this, I've decided I will put aside two minutes of each day to focus on meditation. If I find I can, then I would like to increase that to ten minutes. Two minutes minimum, though.
