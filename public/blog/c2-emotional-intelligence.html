      <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
      <p>I liked the idea of 'high resolution' awareness of emotion, the ability to percieve emotion and changes in emotions in finer detail. I also liked the beginning focus on concentration as that is something I can have trouble with. That is also why I like the Pomodoro Technique.</p>
      <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>I enjoy yoga so I am familiar with the idea of paying attention to my body, especially with a focus on breathing. I think that is actually my favourite part of yoga. I enjoy the time taken out of a busy day to relax and to reflect on my feelings.</p>
