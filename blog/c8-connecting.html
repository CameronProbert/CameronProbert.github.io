        <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust
          and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
        <p>
          I haven't yet, I've been working on Phase 0 this week!
        </p>
        <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
        <p>
          I found it much more emotional than the previous listening technique.
          I feel like I actually got a deeper understanding of what my partner was
          saying compared to the Mindful Conversation exercise, as well as understanding
          better how they were actually feeling during their experience.
        </p>
        <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
        <p>
          I felt very emotional and upset, thinking about a person I know who has
          self-confidence issues and depression. I sincerely meant everything I
          wished for them. It did reinforce my feelings towards them too.

          <em>Assuming I was 100% correct:</em>
          <br />
          When I was living in a student flat over the summer temporarily, before other
          students arrived and I would be moving out, I helped them set up the internet.
          Everything was set up and I ended up moving out of the flat at the end of the
          summer, as planned. About half-way through the year, one of the students at the
          flat (I'll call her Abby) who I didn't get along with, told me that they were
          unsatisfied with the internet, after having a salesperson knock on the door,
          and they wanted to change to another plan. They wanted me to pay the full
          $200 disconnection fee because the internet was still under my name (a lesson
          was definitely learned there), and I had set up internet they thought was
          unsatisfactory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went around to the flat to talk to all the students there. We all gathered
          in the lounge. Abby was the only one who talked to me and was adamant that I
          pay the full $200 fee. I felt attacked and none of the other students would
          back either of us up so I was got the impression that they were ambivalent
          over the whole situation. I ended up offering a compromise: There were 6 students,
          so I would pay 2 parts, and they would each pay 1 part each. $25 each and
          $50 for me. I was still unhappy about being asked to pay for something that
          I felt didn't concern me at all, but I was glad to reach an agreement where
          they didn't expect me to pay all $200, especially as they had all the power
          as the contract was in my name and I would have to spend $200 anyway if they
          decided that they would stop paying their bills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Abby ended up leaving the flat pretty shortly after that, before
          we got around to changing the contract and none of the others ever contacted
          me about the internet until they left the house at the end of the year.

          so I should have to pay the fee because it was my mistake. I ended up offering
          a compromise and they took it because $25 is a relatively small amount to pay
          to get working internet.

          <em>My Reflection:</em>
          <br />
          I can see that these stories are extremely similar. I found it hard to write
          from Abby's perspective because I still feel very bitter about the experience.
          I helped them get their flat set up and ended up getting bitten for it. I was
          also stuck with a $100 fee for not returning the router at the end of the
          contract.
          <br />
          Looking back at the situation I think that our situation arose purely because
          of how we each perceived me setting up the internet. I thought I was doing
          them a service by helping them get internet. I guess Abby thought I was
          looking out for my own needs and not the flat's with the contract/telco I chose.
          I think if I found myself in this situation again I would still help with
          choosing the internet but I would make sure it was under a permanent resident's
          name and not my own.
