        <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
        <p>
          Javascript is used alongside HTML and CSS to alter the page in response to the user's actions.
        </p>
        <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>
        <p>
          Control flow is the process of doing something, for example, when brushing your teeth you:
          <ol>
            <li>Grab your toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Put toothpaste on your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Wet your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Spit the toothpaste out.</li>
            <li>Brush your tongue.</li>
            <li>Rinse your toothbrush.</li>
          </ol>
          A loop is when you repeat this, such as in the morning and evening. (And after lunch in South Korea where I'm teaching at the moment!)
        </p>
        <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
        <p>
          When accessing data from an array you need to know where in the array the data is and use a number to refer to that, such as the 5th object in the array. When accessing data from an object you need to use the name given to that piece of data, for example, object.eyeColour.
        </p>
        <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
        <p>
          Functions are sections of code that has been given a name. You can make the code run by typing the name. This is very useful to avoid having to retype code all the time, making the code more readable and easier to alter.
