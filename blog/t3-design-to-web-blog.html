            <h5>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h5>
            <p>
              A site the alters its layout depending on the size of the browser window/screen. It's useful so that a screen of any kind can view the website without elements being the wrong size and therefore hindering usability.

            <h5>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h5>
            <p>
              Mobile first design is creating the website first to look good on smaller screens, and then scaling it up to also look good on larger screen. This is important because it is easier to shuffle good looking elements to fit a larger grid layout than it is
              to condense a grid layout into a single column view.

            <h5>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h5>
            <p>
              A CSS framework is a ready-built CSS document that should use good standards and should have many useful tools already implemented. This takes a lot of the work out of creating a new webpage, and helps in making a good webpage. The downside of this is
              that it requires reading of the framework's documentation (and it may take more effort to actually understand how to use the framework after that).

            <h5>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h5>
            <p>
              A wireframe is a plan for a webpage that shows how elements should be laid out. It makes it much easier to proportion elements of the webpage, and makes it easier to understand the layout.

              <h5>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h5>
              <p>
                I made the wireframes very simple so they were not difficult to implement. The hardest part was using the skeleton framework to set the column widths. I had to use the <code>&lt;row&gt;</code> element to surround both the navigation and
                content divs to set them to be next to each other. I think I might be doing something wrong there because it doesn't seem right.
