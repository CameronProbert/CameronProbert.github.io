          Having just started Enspiral Dev Academy's (EDA) phase 0, I am very
          excited to polish my skills as a web developer. I think EDA offers a
          very balanced perspective to working in the technology industry. I
          am particularly interested in doing things related to mindfulness and
          keeping a balanced work and private life.
          <br>
          <br>
          I would like to fully engage with my team-mates during my time with
          EDA. I have prior programming experience from my Bachelors of Science
          with computer science and I tutored students after my first year
          studying. Because of this I'm ready to help my cohort and I'm ready
          learn from them because everyone is good at different things.
          <br>
          <br>
          I chose to study with EDA because of the way they marketed themselves
          - as a course that teaches up to date web development skills, with a
          very high graduate employment rate in the field. I still expect this
          from them, and I am ready to commit myself to this. I have been especially
          impressed talking to the EDA staff about their positions on student
          learning (highly collaborative) and social equality and diversity.
          <br>
          <br>
          Working in the highly collaborative environment of EDA makes me nervous as
          I will have to rely on others to produce work, and I have been disappointed
          by others in the past. However, each new team deserves to be trusted
          until proven otherwise and I'm looking to learn a lot from my new
          team-mates as well as other skills like leadership and planning.
