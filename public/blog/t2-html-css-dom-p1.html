		<h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
		<p>HTML is all the text on a page. It is like a supermarket and all the produce inside it.
		CSS is like the layout of the supermarket. All the aisles and signs making it easier to navigate.
		The DOM is a representation of that supermarket to make it easier to interact with. For example, shopping online you don't pick up every item to inspect it, you can only choose the kind of item to buy.</p>
		<h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
		<p>When you look at a webpage you can see that everything appears to be laid out in segments according to its contents and function. This is boxification.</p>
		<h4>What is the box model?</h4>
		<p>The box model is how CSS places the content on a page or within an element. It specifies the height and width of the content, its padding, its border and its margin.</p>

              I like that this design utilises the whole screen. I think the colour
              palette, while strong, doesn't clash with itself. I think that the
              transparent containing divs look good, and would like to implement that myself.

              I like the alternating left and right aligned images that this css implements.
              I have decided for the moment to implement this into my website, using the
              flex layout.

              I like the full page look of Verde Moderna. The subtle design behind the
              content of the page looks really nice. I think that seeing this design,
              as well as Screen Filler (above), I can see that slight transparency can
              really make a website pop.

              The simplistic design of this css caught my attention. I would consider
              trying to implement in my blog simple icons as shown here. In Verde Moderna
              instead of stylised icons like this, abbreviations were used as links to
              these other pages, but I couldn't tell what they were linking to without
              hovering over them to see the address context tips.
