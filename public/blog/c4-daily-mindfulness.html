        <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
        <p>
          I did the exercise with my wife and we often have comfortable silences in our conversations. However, because the other person was intently focusing on the speaker and was also not able to fill in the silence we both found it a little awkward.
        </p>
        <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
        <p>
          I will use 'Meditation Circuit Training' as I think that is what I can fit in easily into each day.
        </p>
        <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
        <p>
          I feel like the formal conversation exercises pushed me to talk about my deeper feelings as I tried to expand on what I was talking about to have something to talk about for 3 minutes (I'm not much of a talker).
