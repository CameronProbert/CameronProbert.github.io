        <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>
        <p>
          I can't say I've had much experience with leaders who actively try to show
          compassion to others, but, I certainly feel that those leaders who people
          liked the most have been the most effective leaders I have had.
        </p>
        <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
        <p>
          I enjoyed it. I find it amazing how well I can visualise something happening,
          like breathing in my 'aura' and multiplying it back into the world.
        </p>
        <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
        <p>
          Again, I felt as if I could strongly visualise the process, but I didn't
          feel like I gained very much during this exercise. In fact, the visualisation
          felt very superficial because of that.
        </p>
        <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>
        <p>
          I didn't have the opportunity to work with anyone during Phase 0 - or even
          make it to any of the check-ins, which is a shame because I feel like the
          other students are already forming inter-personal bonds with each other.
          S - Status: During Phase 0 I have been consistently improving against
          myself. I did not have a great deal of HTML/CSS experience before this.
          During the bootcamp, I will continue to do this.
          <br />
          C - Certainty: I have definitely felt the effects of a large amount of
          uncertainty during (but not related to) Phase 0. I have been extremely
          stressed because of it and definitely felt as though my decision making
          skills were hampered because of it.
          <br />
          A - Autonomy: After taking mitigating steps against the uncertainty that
          was stressing me, I felt much better. I'm glad I had the autonomy to be
          able to take these steps. I agree with Meng's statement that it's the
          "helplessness in the face of stress" that actually causes bad feelings.
          <br />
          R - Relatedness: As I wrote earlier, I haven't actually made it to any check-ins
          for my cohort, and so I haven't met any of them. However, I met and talked
          to Jack and Harrison from EDA and when I've had to talk to them they have
          been very nice, friendly, and relatable and that gives me the confidence
          to ask for anything I need to help me with Phase 0 or EDA in general.
          <br />
          F - Fairness: Fairness has not had a big impact on my Phase 0. I have been
          doing everything alone so I've not had to compromise with anyone else.
          Harrison at one point 'suggested' a deadline to complete up to Sprint 7
          before which was very fair (in fact, I'm completing Sprint 9 now, well
          before the end of February, which was the deadline).
        </p>
        <h5>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill,
          but can take practice to develop!)</h5>
        <p>
          I talked to my wife about something that had been on my mind recently.
          She is a very empathetic person and was only supportive of me, and then
          she also raised some things that had been on her mind too. I think it
          really helped the both of us to share with each other things that had been
          stressing us and we know that we both have very suppoortive partners in
          each other.
