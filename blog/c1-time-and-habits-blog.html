    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <p>
      After reading about time management as part of EDA Phase 0, I
      have decided I will try the Pomodoro Technique. I notice that
      Toggl has this functionality built in.
      <br>

      I find it interesting that many guides that talk about time
      management almost focus more on break times than productive
      times. I guess that if you work solidly for a long period of
      time then you burn out, and you can't really call that 'time
      management'.
	  <br><br>
	  Update: I have been trying to use the Pomodoro Technique and
	  have been enjoying it so far. I have found that I can work on
	  a problem without interruption or distraction for 25 minutes
	  and the break time lets me do things that I have been thinking
	  about while working and get them out of my system.
	  <br><br>
      which will you experiment further with?
	  I'm going to keep using the Pomodoro technique for the foreseeable
	  future. I am sure I will only get better at it as I continue
	  using it.
