        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
        <p>Grid based design is a way of boxifying the layout of a web page in a logical manner.
        It helps the developer to visualise the layout as they are coding, and to easily modify
        the layout of the elements.</p>
        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
        <p>There are so many different sized screens being used to access webpages nowadays that
        a webpage is not going to look attractive on each webpage unless the webpage responds
        to the screen size.</p>
        <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
        <p>Semantic structure is structure (such as HTML tags) that makes it easier for humans
        to understand the code.</p>
        <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
        <p>I really liked the placeholder image sites. I found it a shame that the placeholder
        kittens did not have images outside of the most common picture resolutions, though.</p>
