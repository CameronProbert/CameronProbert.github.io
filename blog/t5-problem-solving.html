        <h5>A simple problem I got blocked on</h5>
        <p>
          A simple problem I got stuck on was when making a heuristic for a roadmap in Java. I needed to find a function that would represent the fastest way from A to B.
          The answer was the time taken to travel the direct distance (as the crow flies, not by road), by going at the max speed limit (100km/hr in New Zealand).
        </p>
        <p>
          While trying to solve this problem I talked to my friends who were also tring to figure it out, and we used trial and error to test some different heuristics.
        <br />I was annoyed that I couldnt figure out how to solve this problem, as it was necessary to get an A for the university assignment.
        <br />I learned that I can't always solve a problem, but other people did figure the answer out, so I can always ask others for help if I need it.
        </p>
        <h5>A problem I solved elegantly</h5>
        <p>
          At university I had an assignment to make a webpage using Javascript that would be used on wearable glasses (such as Google Glasses).
          These glasses would have swipe controls on one side of the glasses, giving 5 inputs. Swipe forward, backwards, up, down and a tap.
          I had to make an interface that would work well with these glasses, but the problem was testing it using the swipe controls.
          I ended up implementing 5 buttons that would simulate each of these inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />I think this worked well. It wouldn't be able to gauge the speed of the swipes, but for my program that didn't matter.
          What I liked about this solution is that it was so simple compared to the much more complicated things I was doing for the rest of the assignment.
          <br />Sometimes simple solutions can be the most elegant.

        <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
        <p>I will often write pseudocode as a comment in code before writing a function out. It think it is really useful to avoid missing steps in algorithms.</p>

        <h5>Trying something (Trial and Error)</h5>
        <p>For basic problems that I have a pretty good understanding of, I often uses this. Especially in problems like position of HTML elements using CSS.</p>

        <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
        <p>I haven't tried this before, so I'm not sure how effective I would find it.</p>

        <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
        <p>Whenever I have a generated error message I will always read it. It really frustrates me when programs do not use good error messaging. When I write programs I like to write good, descriptive error messages.</p>

        <h5>Console.logging</h5>
        <p>I often uses this in conjuction with error message. It's one of the main methods I use to solve problems in my code.</p>

        <h5>Googling</h5>
        <p>If I am trying to solve a problem that I do not know the answer to, I will usually use Google to search for peoples' answers to similar problems.</p>

        <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
        <p>If Google doesn't help me, or I can see that a peer has already solved the problem, then I will ask a peer for help. This usually leads to more actual learning than Googling a problem, as well as better relations with the peer.</p>

        <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
        <p>If I still don't have an answer I will then ask a coach for help. I think it is usually better to ask a peer first though, unless in a case where I want to know best practice or alternate solutions to something I've already found.</p>

        <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
        <p>I very rarely do this in a written format when I'm not prompted to, but I will often think about other ways I could have solved a problem.</p>
