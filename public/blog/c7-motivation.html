        <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
        <p>
          Currently I chase pleasure and sometimes get in the groove while coding.
          Actually, as a gamer, I wonder if I get into the 'flow' state while gaming.
          I can do it for days without getting bored!
        </p>
        <h5>What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h5>
        <p>
          My core values are equality, happiness, fairness and team spirit.
          I would love for there to be no conflict between gender, peoples, age
          groups and "social classes".
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to be able to own my own company and run it the way I want.
          I think people work too hard. I think that people with intensive, creative
          jobs are unproductive for much of the day because it is very hard to be
          productive while coding for 8 hours a day. I would require employees to
          work 4-6 hour days.
        </p>
        <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
        <p>
          I recognised a lot within myself when reading this chapter. I am a very
          happy person and not much gets me down for a prolonged period of time.
          If I am upset I only need to mention my feelings to someone (for example,
          my wife) and I instantly become happy again.

          In terms of success and failure, I feel that I haven't done much that is
          very important, but one of the big successes of my life is finding my
          wife, who is an absolutely amazing person!
