        <h5> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
        <p>
          They are essentially the same thing, except mindfulness may be focused on something external to the body, while self-awareness is internal only.
        </p>
        <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
        <p>
          I tried journaling, as I have done similar practices to body scan during yoga (and fell asleep during them sometimes!). I wrote about what I was aware of, and what I aspire to do today. It helped me understand the things that might disrupt me while I try to knock out a lot of work today. I feel more focused now, and ready to do a good amount of work.
        </p>
        <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
        <p>
          I think that this part had been summarised in an earlier part of the book, but it really hit me when I read it earlier that I can acknowledge my feelings without pushing them away or allowing them to alter my behaviour.
