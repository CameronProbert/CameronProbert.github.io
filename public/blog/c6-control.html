        <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
        <p>
          I find it so frustrating when code that should compile just doesn't, and then restarting the IDE allows it to compile.
          I think this annoys me so much because I did everything right, so it's not my fault, but I spent a long time trying to figure out the compilation error.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also find it frustrating when there is a particular nuance that I haven't understood in something that is causing a problem.
          In this sprint I had this happen twice while trying to use a <code>for (x in y)</code> loop. It doesn't seem to work exactly
          as it does in Java. I had to replace both instances of it with <code>for (var i = 0; i < y.length; i++)</code> loops.
          I think that it may have been iterating over <code>y</code> in a way I wasn't expecting.

        <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
        <p>
          I was surprised by how simulating the experience in my mind really made me physically feel the same way as I had in the actual moment.
          I also found that I could then make the physical feeling disappear by relaxing and concentrating on my breathing.
